            <p class="lead">
                Neighborly is a crowdsourcing-based resource guide created by Project for Healing, Inc. and
                WeaveTales to help immigrants, refugees, and low-income families in Northeast Florida better
                navigate the resources available in their areas. Neighborly features the locations and information
                on providers of core services such as food, housing, and legal aid. The website is accessible through
                a direct URL: <a href="http://neighborlyguide.org" target="_blank">neighborlyguide.org</a>​ or <a href="http://neighborly.guide" target="_blank">​neighborly.guide​.</a>

                Neighborly runs on information crowdsourced by the users and service providers. The website will
                have submission links where users and service providers could add information. Our staff at WeaveTales will
                screen all submissions on a regular basis and publish them online. If needed, the person submitting the information
                or the service providers will be contacted to ensure the accuracy and quality of the information on the website before
                making it public. Some of these screening and approval processes will take place at the monthly user meetings that WeaveTales will host.
                Anyone interested in using or currently using Neighborly is welcome to join the meeting. The dates and locations of the meetings
                may vary each month and will be posted on <a href="http://www.weavetales.org/events​" target="_blank">www.weavetales.org/events​</a> and our Twitter account (<a href="https://twitter.com/neighborlyguide​" target="_blank">twitter.com/neighborlyguide</a>).

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Against the backdrop of drastic budget cuts at the federal level since 2017, immigrant and refugee communities, as well as many low-income families,
                have been gradually turned away from various social services that have helped their successful integration to the American society for the past two generations. Unfortunately,
                Jacksonville and Northeast Florida have been no exception to this growing challenge. The lack of access to adequate services reportedly led to a number of newcomers and low-income
                households falling victim to scams and unethical business practices over the years.

                In April 2019, Christine Rothberg and Basma Alawee met at a regular Refugee Taskforce Meeting and began compiling a list of trusted and welcoming resources in the local area to
                address the challenge. The initial idea was to draft up a list that fits on a single-page document; over the next few months, however, more volunteers joined the effort and the
                list quickly expanded. Eventually, a group of students from the University of North Florida (UNF) volunteered to turn the list into an online database that can be visualized on a
                publicly accessible map for easy use. In January 2020, WeaveTales was officially appointed to manage, maintain, and update the database and since then,  WeaveTales has
